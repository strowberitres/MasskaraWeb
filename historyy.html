                                                <p class="branding-collection-list-text">The name "Bacolod" is derived from the Hiligaynon word "Buklod," which means "stone hill," and refers to the stone hill where the earliest Austronesians landed in the region. Following an invasion by Moro (Muslim) pirates, the original town was moved to the shore. The historical town is now known as Daan-Banwa, and it is located in Barangay Granada.

Its northern, eastern, and southern borders are formed by the cities of Talisay, Murcia, and Bago, respectively. It is a coastal city that the Guimaras Strait borders on the west. <br> <span class="red-span">- Location</span>

                                                <p class="branding-collection-list-text">In 1890, Bacolod was designated as the provincial capital of Negros Occidental. It was the site of a fight between the Negrenses and the Spaniards in 1898, which resulted in the foundation of the Negros Island Republic. This Republic, however, survived only a year.<br> <span class="red-span">- Spanish Era</span>

Bacolod has grown from its humble beginnings to become an urbanized metropolis, and it is now regarded as one of the two cleanest and greenest highly urbanized cities in the Philippines.  <span class="red-span"><br>- World War II</span></p>

Each of the city's barangays (districts) competes for the best-costumed group, best in choreography, and other awards. The usage of bright masks with big smiles symbolizes the city's moniker, "City of Smiles."

                                                <p class="branding-collection-list-text">The annual MassKara Festival, celebrated on the fourth Sunday of October, is well-known in Bacolod. The event receives its name from the masks used by the dancers. Another significant event is the Panaad sa Negros Festival, which takes place in April. It is a type of thankfulness and a remembrance of a commitment made in return for a good life.

The region was dealing with a drop in the price of sugar, its principal source of income, as well as the aftermath of a catastrophic boat accident. The event was created to raise people's spirits and serve as a beacon of hope and strength during these trying times. The term "MassKara" is a combination of the English words "mass" (crowd) and "cara" (face), resulting in "MassKara" (a multitude of faces).
